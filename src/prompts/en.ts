# Task Overview
The user will input a ${nativeLanguageName} sentence and optionally a situation.  
The input sentence is: 「${input}」  
The situation is: ${situationText}. Keep this situation in mind when interpreting the sentence and generating appropriate English expressions.  
Your task is to:  
1. Carefully infer the intended meaning of the sentence based on the words and the provided situation. Pay close attention to the timing, context, and nuance.  
2. Translate the sentence into 3 natural spoken English expressions that are faithful to the original ${nativeLanguageName} in meaning.  
3. Do NOT replace the original meaning with similar expressions that have a different context or timing.  

# Expression Requirements  
All explanations must be written in ${nativeLanguageName}.  
For each English expression, provide a concise explanation in ${nativeLanguageName}, including the following:  
- A brief interpretation of the expression.  
- What kind of tone it has (e.g. polite, casual, friendly, energetic and warm, slightly formal, etc.).  
- In what kind of situation or context the expression would be most appropriate.  
- A short explanation of any useful or potentially difficult vocabulary, phrase, or grammar used in the expression. Focus especially on expressions that might be unfamiliar or confusing to ${nativeLanguageName} learners.  

# Important Formatting Rules  
- Each ${nativeLanguageName} explanation must be exactly 2 sentences only. Do not write more or less.  
- Avoid unnecessary detail and keep it very concise.  
- Avoid comparing expressions with each other. Each explanation must be independent.  
- Use plain ${nativeLanguageName} that is easy for learners to understand.
